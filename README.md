# ML-homework
This is my homework for lesson Information System Modeling.
This work mainly follows https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE and run the codes on two new datasets found on http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html.
The processed data from //Bitcoin OTC trust weighted signed network, https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-otc.html// and //Math Overflow temporal network, http://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-mathoverflow.html// are saved in folder 'benchmark/soc2/' and folder 'benchmark/math'.
Runable files are named after the used model and dataset.
And in folder examples are the given examples by the original OpenKE.
The data are processed through the 'da_xxx.ipynb' and 'n-n.py' in the corresponding dataset folder following the data description instructions in the original README, which is renamed as 'README-OLD'.
